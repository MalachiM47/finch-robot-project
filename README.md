# Final Project: Finch Robot Challenges

## Essential Question
How can we apply object-oriented programming principles and Java concepts to create interactive, autonomous robot behaviors that solve real-world challenges?

## Project Overview
In this project-based learning experience, you will program a Finch 2.0 robot to perform one of three challenges:
1. Choreograph a dance routine (with movement, lights, and sound)
2. Create an artistic drawing using the robot's movements
3. Navigate a maze autonomously

## Learning Objectives
- Apply Java programming concepts in a physical computing context
- Implement object-oriented design principles
- Develop problem-solving skills through algorithm development
- Create well-documented and maintainable code
- Practice technical communication through presentations and documentation

## Description of design choices
- Coded an algorithm that allowed the Finch 2.0 Robot to be able to navigate a maze and get the end.
- We also added a snippet of Jingle Bells to be played after the Robot reaches the end of the Maze.

## Challenges faced and solutions
- At first we set out to use the sensor to navigate the maze but it had limitations.
- We then decided that we would program the Robot to specifically be able to reach the end of one maze instead of being able to navigate all mazes.

## Future enhancements
- With more time me and my partner would have liked to make the algorithm more multifaceted and use more than just the turn and move methods to reach the end of the maze.
